Welcome to my HW5 Scrabble Column.

When you drag the tiles to the board, the magic automatically happens.

First the board checks for any gaps between letters. If gaps are found, an error is returned.

Then the word is collected and sent to the datamuse api (https://api.datamuse.com/) to check if it's a valid word. If the word is not valid, an error is returned.

If the word is valid, the points are collected and demonstrated to the user.

The board has one button - to reset the tiles and start from scratch.

Thank you for playing :)
